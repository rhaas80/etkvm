# packages is installed:
#
#   perl gfortran g++ libmpich2-dev

# In addition, installing the following list of packaed will prevent Cactus
# from compiling it's own versions of these libraries:
#
#   libfftw3-dev libgsl0-dev libatlas-base-dev libjpeg-dev libssl-dev libhdf5-serial-dev

# Tools like GetComponents and Simfactory like to have the following list
# installed too
#
#   python subversion git mercurial

# Whenever this version string changes, the application is configured
